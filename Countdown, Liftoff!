//Below is much cleaner code.  Not sure how I pigeonholed myself into decrementing everything by one.  I was attempting to omit the /br number from being displayed after the command and that was my work around.
//glitchInTheSystem, as always, presented me with the cleaner code.  My goal is to produce code more cleanly from here on out.
